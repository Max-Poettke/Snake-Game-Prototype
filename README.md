# Snake-Game-Prototype
First Prototype of the Snake game Idea.

Features as of now: 
- Normal Snake game with Food and a score
- Snake body which turns into TD-Track
- Prototype Enemy which moves along the dead snake body
- Placeable Towers which show their range when hovering over them with the mouse and can detect enemies in said radius
- Towers can shoot at enemies and enemies die after having been hit a couple of times

Found Bugs:
- Food can spawn inside the Snake
- When crashing into yourself, the starting point of the enemies would be inside yourself so there would be a track overlap
- When ending the snake-game and entering the tower defense sequence, if you died while swapping sides (left-right), enemies go across 
  the map instead of teleporting to the next snake part

Plans:
- Make enemy movement smoother (Finished) 
- Create actual projectiles (Finished)
- Create different enemies and towers
- Create a lives counter or similar game-mechanic
- Create a UI for selecting tower types
- Make a pause menu
- Have fun (Kinda important :p ) (in Progress)

Big ole maybes:
- Create a multiplayer mode (Tron style)
- Create a Scoreboard which shows previous scores
- Create multiple Levels with obstacles and different hurdles/strategies
